# Platform-Mesh virtual workspaces


## Getting Started

To start the service locally you need some trusted certificates. You can generate them using the following command:

```bash
mkcert -cert-file=.secret/apiserver.crt -key-file=.secret/apiserver.key localhost
```

Also make sure you have `mkcert` installed and trusted its store in your system.

The Kubeconfigs server url needs to point to the **root** of the kcp instance (*not the root cluster*), meaning only the url.

            "mode": "auto",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/main.go",
            "args": [
                "start",
                "--tls-cert-file=${workspaceFolder}/.secret/apiserver.crt",
                "--tls-private-key-file=${workspaceFolder}/.secret/apiserver.key",
                "--secure-port=6443",
                "--bind-address=0.0.0.0",
                "--authentication-kubeconfig=${workspaceFolder}/.secret/authentication.yaml",
                "--client-ca-file=${workspaceFolder}/.secret/kcp-ca.crt",
                "--authentication-skip-lookup"
            ],
            "envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.env",
        }
    ]
}
```

The *authentication-kubeconfig* can be a copy of the kubeconfig file you use to access the kcp instance, but with the server-url pointing to the root clusters.
